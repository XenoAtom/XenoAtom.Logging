# Summary
Core logging namespace shared by the runtime and terminal package, including terminal-specific logging extension methods.

# Remarks
When `XenoAtom.Logging.Terminal` is referenced, this namespace is extended with markup-oriented logging helpers (for example `InfoMarkup`, `ErrorMarkup`) on top of the core logging APIs.
