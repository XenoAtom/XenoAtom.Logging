# Summary
Core logging namespace for XenoAtom.Logging, including runtime configuration, logger APIs, levels, scopes, and structured properties.

# Remarks
Use this namespace to initialize `LogManager`, resolve `Logger` instances, and write logs with events/properties/scopes. It also contains source-generation entry points such as `[LogMethod]`, `[LogMethodMarkup]`, and `[LogFormatter]`.
